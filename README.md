# Zia Customizer Website
This is a personal project to create a responsive website that allows users to customize the colors of a zia symbol against a background.

On the road home from my first New Mexico camping trip with my friends, and upon discovering the awesome zia symbol, I wanted to make a website to customize the color of the zia against a background.
