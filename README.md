This is a personal project to create a responsive website that allows users to customize the colors of a zia symbol against a background.

On the road home from my first New Mexico camping trip with my friends, and upon discovering the awesome zia symbol, I wanted to make a website to customize the color of the zia against a background.

Please know: I am a young computer science major interested in learning how to make websites and improve on my very basic knowledge, as evidenced by this project.

I would like to add the following features:

a responsive design to the page
different zia background sizes
